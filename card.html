			    <p>Koalas are well-known marsupials that live in Australia. Most people can easily recognize these mammals by their greyish fur, fluffy ears, and large black noses. Though some people call them “Koala bears,” they are not related to bears in any way, shape, or form! In fact, their closest relative is the wombat.</p>

			    <p>Sea turtles are large, air-breathing reptiles that inhabit tropical and subtropical seas throughout the world. Sea turtles come in many different sizes, shapes and colors. Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified “beaks” suited to their particular diet. They do not have visible ears but have eardrums covered by skin.</p>
